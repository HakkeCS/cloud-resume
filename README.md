My resume hosted on Azure

The ACG Cloud Resume Challenge!

### What's done so far:

- Updated HTML template with personal information
- wrote code for the visitor counter in main.js
    - Need to lean into to js a bit more. 

Setup cosmosDB to store our counter data and trudged through writing an Azure function to pull the data and add to it for each visitor to the site. 

Set up static site hosting with azure blob storage.
